Research Curtailment and Remote Work
============================

Introduction
============
COVID-19 and UBCâ€™s research curtailment are impacting all aspects of teaching and scholarship and changing the way we approach these activities. The Dynamic Brian Circuits (DBC) cluster will present approaches and tools which have become useful (or more useful) to enable collaboration and remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic.  This meeting will be hosted by Dr. Tim Murphy (lead Dynamic Brain Circuits cluster) and consist of 5, 10 min talks: Slack Workspaces (Peter Hogg, DBC Neurodata tutor, Haas lab), Open Science Framework (Annika Wevers, DBC co-op student), remote access to computers (Jeff LeDue, DMCBH), running jobs on the Alder computer cluster (Justin Jao, Ciernia lab) and remote data analysis with Jupyterhub (Patrick Coleman, Haas lab).

Remote Access
============
Remote Access to computers can be achieved in many different ways.  Computers in the DMCBH NeuroImaging and NeuroComputation Centre are available for remote access with teamviewer or Microsoft Remote Desktop.  Each of these computers has 6-cores and 64GB RAM and run windows and linux.  Join us on the DBC slack for help with access.

Running jobs on the Alder computer cluster
============
DMCBH Alder is a cluster computer with 9 nodes....

Remote data analysis with Jupyterhub
============
DMCBH Alder also has a Jupyterhub...
