Research Curtailment and Remote Work
============================

Introduction
============
COVID-19 and UBCâ€™s research curtailment are impacting all aspects of teaching and scholarship and changing the way we approach these activities. The Dynamic Brian Circuits (DBC) cluster will present approaches and tools which have become useful (or more useful) to enable collaboration and remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic.  This meeting will be hosted by Dr. Tim Murphy (lead Dynamic Brain Circuits cluster) and consist of 5, 10 min talks: Slack Workspaces (Peter Hogg, DBC Neurodata tutor, Haas lab), Open Science Framework (Annika Wevers, DBC co-op student), remote access to computers (Jeff LeDue, DMCBH), running jobs on the Alder computer cluster (Justin Jao, Ciernia lab) and remote data analysis with Jupyterhub (Patrick Coleman, Haas lab).

Slack Workspaces
============

OSF
============
Open Science Framework (OSF) is a free and open source project management tool. OSF enables collaboration on projects and streamlines the workflow process by integrating already existing platforms such as Dropbox and GitHub. UBC is an OSF Institution, which means researchers can affiliate their OSF account and projects with UBC and login to OSF is possible using their university credentials. 

Remote Access
============
Remote Access to computers can be achieved in many different ways.  Computers in the DMCBH NeuroImaging and NeuroComputation Centre are available for remote access with teamviewer or Microsoft Remote Desktop.  Each of these computers has 6-cores and 64GB RAM and run windows and linux.  Join us on the DBC slack for help with access.

Running jobs on the Alder computer cluster
============
DMCBH Alder is a cluster computer with 9 nodes....

Remote data analysis with Jupyterhub
============
DMCBH Alder also has a Jupyterhub...
