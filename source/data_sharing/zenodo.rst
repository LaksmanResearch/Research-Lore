Zenodo
======
`Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`_ 
is an open access data repository operated by CERN [1]_ . 
It is hosted on the high-performance infrastructure operated for the needs of high-energy physics
[#]_ .

Location
--------
Zenodo is hosted by CERN, which has an experimental programme defined for at least the next 20 years. 
The technical infrastructure is located on CERN’s premises on CERN’s EOS service in an 18 PB disk cluster, 
with two copies kept of each file on difference disk servers. 
Checksums are used to detect changes and enable automatic corruption detection and recovery.

Size Limits
-----------
The maximum they accept per dataset is 50GB, with the ability to upload an unlimited amount of datasets. 
If larger files are to be uploaded, they can be contacted to discuss further. 

Changes
-------
If changes need to be made to the dataset, due to reasons such as typos or accidental omissions,
and the upload was made within a week, a contact request can be made with Zenodo to make the modification.
Once the record has been published, you cannot change the files on record.

Collaboration and Data Sharing
------------------------------
You can create collections and control what uploads can be made to them.
There are no limitations to what type of data is uploaded any file format
and any results can be submitted. Zenodo  also assigns all publicly accessible
records a DOI to make the upload more accessible and citable. It provides DOI versioning,
such that uploads have a DOI representing a specific version of the dataset or a DOI
representing all the versions. This allows for specific citations to be made.
Github integration is also included, which allows users to track each release.
There are also over 400 licenses available to choose from to assign to your datasets.
