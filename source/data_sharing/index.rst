Discovering Open Data
=====================
The `CONP portal <conp.ca>`_ promises to deliver a central repository aggregating metadata from multiple platforms, allowing researchers to discover open data. As the portal is still under development, we have compiled a list of resources that can be used for this purpose:

* `Registry of Research Data Repositories <re3data.org>`_ - Discover open data repositories across the globe
* bioCADDIE <biocaddie.org>`_ - Biomedical and healthcare data discovery and indexing ecosystem
* `Federated Research Data Repository <frdr.ca>`_ - FRDR crawls through multiple other Canadian data repositories including dataverses, FRDRâ€™s own data and government open data (view a full list `here <frdr.ca/discover/html/repository-list.html?lang=en>`_), allowing users to search for and discover data from multiple sources
* `CRCNS <crcns.org>`_ - Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience. Hosts data from projects funded by their funding program.
* Center for Open Neuroscience `<centerforopenneuroscience.org>`_ -  open software frameworks, platforms, data and methodologies for neuroscience
* `OpenNeuro <openneuro.org>`_ - free and open platform for sharing MRI, MEG, EEG, iEEG, and ECoG data

Lists that have been compiled by other sources:

* `Awesomedata <github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets#neuroscience>`_ - A list of open neuroscience data platforms
* `Opening up: open access publishing, data sharing, and how they can influence your neuroscience career <onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ejn.13234>`_ - Table 2. Popular data sharing repositories
