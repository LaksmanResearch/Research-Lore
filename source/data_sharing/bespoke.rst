Bespoke solutions
==============
In some cases, a custom data sharing solution is required, for instance, due to the need to host 
a persistent database, a website or a highly specialised analysis environment.

Compute Canada Cloud
--------------------
To get a Cloud project, the PI must have an active cloud resource allocation as part of their 
Resource Allocation Competition (RAC) allocation. Users sponsored under such a PI can request 
access to a Cloud project, and have to be granted access by their PI.
Read the documentation `here <https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Cloud>`__.

EduCloud
--------
EduCloud can be accessed on-demand and may be faster and easier to set up than on Compute Canada 
Cloud, but costs money. You must `apply for an EduCloud account <https://web.it.ubc.ca/forms/systems/>`_ 
before you can use the service.

From the `UBC IT Website <https://it.ubc.ca/services/web-servers-storage/educloud-server-service>`_ :
    EduCloud Server is a self-managed, private higher education cloud server service that provides simple and secure virtual data centre access to provision, manage and utilize servers at a fraction of the cost of implementing physical servers. EduCloud Server is designed to provide functionality which allows self-management and self-deployment.  EduCloud Server is intended to provide the same convenience and cost effectiveness as other cloud services, while meeting all provincial privacy requirements under the FIPPA legislation.
    EduCloud Server provides the ability to easily self-deploy virtual machines from templates. With this service, you can create and delete virtual machines, and change resource allocation all within minutes.  Managed using a web portal, you have the flexibility of managing your own environment at any time, from anywhere.

The costs of deploying the virtual machines can be found `here <https://it.ubc.ca/services/web-servers-storage/educloud-server-service/pricing-model>`_.
