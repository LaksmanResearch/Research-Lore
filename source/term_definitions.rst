	Metadata :sup:`+`
		“data about data“. Research data file metadata includes elements such as title, file format, language, creator, and date
		
	Data format :sup:`+`
		a particular way of encoding information within a computer file so that it can be recognized by an application
		
	Data Management Plan (DMP) :sup:`+`
		a document you create that sets out how you will organize, store and share your research data at each stage in your project
		
	Data pipeline :sup:`-`
		a collection of processes and systems for organizing the data, computations, and workflows used by a research group as they jointly perform complex sequences of data acquisition, processing, and analysis
	
	(Scientific) Workflow :sup:`@`
		the description of a process for accomplishing a scientific objective, usually expressed in terms of tasks and their dependencies. Typically, scientific workflow tasks are computational steps for scientific simulations or data analysis steps.

	Raw data :sup:`*`
		data directly obtained from the instrument, simulation, or survey
		
	Processed data :sup:`*`
		result from some manipulation of the raw data in order to eliminate errors or outliers, to prepare the data for analysis, to derive new variables, or to de-identify the human participants
		
	Analyzed data :sup:`*`
		results of qualitative, statistical, or mathematical analysis of the processed data. They can be presented as graphs, charts, or statistical tables.
		
	Final data :sup:`*`
