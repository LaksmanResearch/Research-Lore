Data Encryption
===============
Data encryption is a means of securing data by encoding the information such that it can only be decrypted using the appropriate encryption key. Data encryption is a requirement when storing or transmitting sensitive data, especially human data. Nevertheless, it is highly recommended to encrypt all research data.
There are several ways of encrypting data:

* UBC offers `full device encryption <privacymatters.ubc.ca/encrypt-my-devices>`_
* Using backup software with built in encryption capabilities [see previous section]. This is recommended for automation and ease of use.
* Encryption solutions such as `eCryptfs <ecryptfs.org>`_
