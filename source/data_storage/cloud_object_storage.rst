Cloud Object Storage
====================

Cloud storage is increasingly being used in research institutions to store data, especially if they also use the cloud platform for analytics. 

Due to the large costs associated with this option, as well as the fact that it is not considered a UBC System, we do not recommend this option for purposes other than `data archival <https://ubcbraincircuits.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_storage/cloud_object_archival.html>`_. However, such cloud platforms are the best option for on-demand storage and analysis resources and have large flexibility for scaling.

Due to the transaction-based pricing model employed by cloud platforms, it is challenging to determine the costs of their services and therefore labs considering using this solution should consult with experts such as `UBC ARC <https://arc.ubc.ca/>`_.
