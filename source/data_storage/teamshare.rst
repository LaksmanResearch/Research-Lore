As of 7 August 2019, the UBC teamshare service charges a flat rate of `CAD 0.15 per gigabyte per year <https://it.ubc.ca/services/web-servers-storage/teamshare-storage-service/cost-0>`_. 
A minimum of 20 GB must be purchased. Charges will be made monthly to the speed chart provided when making the application.

Signing Up
===========
To sign up for TeamShare, the following `requirements <https://it.ubc.ca/services/web-servers-storage/teamshare-storage-service#getting-started>`_ have to be met:

* An `Enterprise Active Directory (EAD) <https://it.ubc.ca/services/accounts-passwords/enterprise-active-directory>`_ account, which in turn requires a CWL account. 
* All UBC faculty, staff and students have a CWL account. People external to UBC can be `sponsored a CWL account <https://it.ubc.ca/services/accounts-passwords/campus-wide-login-cwl/how-sponsor-guest>`_ to gain access.
* The department must be `onboarded onto EAD <https://it.ubc.ca/services/accounts-passwords/enterprise-active-directory>`_
* A billing contact and speed chart

Once these requirements are met, department administrators can order TeamShare Storage Service by submitting a `Systems Service Request <web.it.ubc.ca/forms/systems>`_.

Access
======
Teamshare can only be accessed through the UBC network or through the `UBC VPN <https://it.ubc.ca/services/email-voice-internet/myvpn>`_. 

CWL is used to log into the VPN, which can be accessed on a variety of systems, of which Windows and MacOS are officially supported. 

Backups
=======
From the TeamShare `website <https://it.ubc.ca/services/web-servers-storage/team-share-storage-service/faqs>`_:

    Backup snapshots are taken:

    * Every 2 hours between 6:00 am and 6:00 pm and kept for 5 days
    * Daily at midnight and kept for 30 days

Teamshare is fully compliant with the 3-2-1 backup rule, with an offsite backup kept in Kamloops. This means that it can be a one stop shop option for data storage and backup, especially for labs that produce small disk volumes of data.
