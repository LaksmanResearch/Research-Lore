Overview
========
The Dynamic Brain Circuits and Connections in Health and Disease research cluster is composed of researchers across departments and faculties united by their collective pursuit of advancing the study of brain connections and their dynamic changes during development, learning, and disease. Within the cluster, there is consensus that data sharing is good and most labs recognize that improvements could be made to their current data practices. However, the perceived goodness of Open Science and lack of systematic data management have not given sufficient impetus to undertake efforts to address these matters. The need  to mobilize the cluster motivated the development of a white paper that aims to provide information, recommendations, and advice on best practices and emerging technologies in data management to aid labs in both the Brain Circuits cluster and other clusters, as well as the greater DMCBH community, to establish and maintain Data Management Plans (DMPs). The aforementioned includes considerations to data storage, data sharing, research data workflows, and data stewardship throughout the research life cycle. 

We are addressing a global shift towards Open Science and the pressing need within the cluster for secure data storage throughout the research process, from collection to long-term preservation. There is an understandable reluctance to invest time, money, and effort into data sharing and there are also potential risks involved, including misuse and misinterpretation of data, and inappropriate or absence of proper assignment of scientific credit. We thus encourage cluster labs to recognize the potential and demonstrated benefits of being scientifically open that can greatly outweigh its drawbacks. Data sharing and transparency increases reliability and reproducibility of research findings, and promotes collaboration. It is often true, however, that the broader benefits of data sharing for the neuroscience community are better perceived than its more direct rewards for the individual lab. Many journals, repositories, and funding agencies now require or encourage open data, and several grant applications now require researchers to outline their data sharing plans. Sharing data can also boost citation count and a proven record of open science can positively impact careers of both new and established neuroscientists. This is especially since Open Science is still in its infancy but will surely be a significant part of the future of science. A precursor to data sharing is data management thus we also acknowledge the cluster-wide issue of vulnerable and unorganized data and large-scale data storage.  

We present a number of possible solutions to the problems posed by the adoption of data sharing and storage best practices, the selection of which was guided by both UBC standards and ethics policies. Since many of the services outlined here are in constant development or have yet to fully launch, we created a website to accompany this paper to update and append to the information presented here. The website contains use cases and demos to aid in the decisions that cluster labs may need to make regarding their data and to ease the strain of set-up and adoption. The primary purpose of this white paper is to reduce the barriers that deter or hinder data sharing and the implementation of DMPs within the cluster. As leaders at the forefront of neuroscience, we must seek an increased uptake of data sharing into the research cycle of the labs and an improved overall data management. 

In pursuit of this goal, we have also provisioned resources for the use of the cluster, including:

* Dataverse
* Federated research Data Repository collection
* JupyterHub
* A central GitHub Team Repository
